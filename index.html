                    <h4>AM:</h4>
                    <p>On Monday, I wake up at 6:30AM at the latest to get ready for work at 8am. 
                        I consider myself a morning person but I need plenty of time to make myself a <em>person</em> again. Sometimes I do get the energy to wake up at 5:00AM. When I do, I typically start the day by exercising for 30 minutes (typically dance) and/or working on prep work and assignments for LC101.
                        I always hope I will have time to exercise or work on some code before work sometimes sleep is more important. At the bare minimum, my mornings tend to look like this:</p>

                    <h4>Typical Morning Todo List:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wake up and play on my phone for 5 minutes while I realize I'm not on Mars.</li>
                            <li>Get up and drink a glass of water.</li>
                            <li>Take a shower and serenade Cashmere while he tries to get in the bathtub.</li>
                            <li>Brush teeth.</li>
                            <li>Apply skincare products and makeup.</li>
                            <li>Do something with my hair.</li>
                            <li>Find something to wear while praying everything isn't in the dirty clothes hamper.</li>
                            <li>Put out Cashmere's food and run to close bathroom and bedroom doors while he's out of hiding.</li>
                            <li><em><strong>If I have to work:</strong></em>Put on shoes and run to the car because I'm probably about to be late to work.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h4>PM:</h4>
                    <p>After working with families at Varsity Tutors all morning to try and ensure they see results with their tutors, I leave work at 4:30PM (yay!) and head to class. 
                        During my drive, I typically talk on the phone with either my mom, grandma, or grandpa to catch up with them. LC101 is tough but I learn so much in a few short hours. 
                        Class is typically helpful because I get to talk about the concepts we've been working on and I get to apply the skills I've obtained in a few short weeks.
                        After class, however, I finally get to <em>"rest"</em>. My night time routine goes a little something like this:</p>

                            <li>Put on PJs.</li>
                            <li>Take off makeup and do my skincare routine.</li>
                            <li>Make sure Cashmere has water and isn't hiding in my room (he likes to attack me in my sleep so he can't stay in there).</li>
                            <li>Read Reddit or Buzzfeed for roughly 30 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Turn out the lights and drift to sleep.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h4>AM:</h4>
                    <p>Tuesday mornings are almost exactly like Monday mornings. 
                        My routine is pretty consistent across the mornings (see my <a href="#typical-morning">Typical Morning Todo List</a>). 
                        However, on Tuesdays, I make a point to journal for a few minutes to keep track of all the things I've been grateful for in the past week. 
                        As usual, I have to go to work by 8am so if I'm running late, I will take a moment to do this as soon as I get to the office before my day really gets going.</p>

                <div class="PM">
                    <h4>PM:</h4>
                    <p>Tuesday afternoons are a little more fluid since I don't have class. I typically will spend at least a couple of hours working on prep work or assignments for class. 
                        Additionally, I've started to learn JavaScript outside of class so I may work on free tutorials online to get used to this new language. 
                        I may also take the time to relax before <a href="#typical-night">getting ready for bed</a>. Here's a list of things I might do to relax:
                        </p>
                    <h4 id="relaxing-activities">My Relaxing Activities:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cook dinner</li>
                        <li>Cleaning my apartment</li>
                        <li>Cuddling or Playing with Cashmere</li>
                        <li>Playing Dance Central (yes, I still have an XBox 360)</li>
                        <li>Facetiming with friends</li>
                        <li>Reading</li>
                        <li>Watching YouTube videos or Netflix</li>

                <div class="AM">
                    <h4>AM:</h4>
                    <p>This is my late day! I don't have to get to work until 10:30 am on these days so I always have very productive mornings! 
                        As a morning person, I get a lot done before work since I don’t have much time in the evening. 
                        In addition to my typical routine (We’ve been through this 3 times already!), I often do the things I enjoy to <a href="#relaxing-activities">relax</a>. 
                        On Wednesdays I always make sure to start planning out my weekend activities as well so I can make the most of my free hours. </p>

                    <h4>PM:</h4>
                    <p>Wednesday evenings wrap up pretty late for me. Since I went to work later, I don’t get off until around 7pm. 
                        Usually I'm dying at this point so I usually only have time to wrap up any left over work that I need to do before class on Thursday. I then do my nightly routine and head to bed. </p>

                    <h4>AM:</h4>
                    <p>Thursday is a fun day for me! I have to go to work at 8am like I normally do but it's the last day of the work week for me. 
                        I do <a href="#typical-morning">my morning routine</a> and head to work typically feeling hopeful for the some time off.</p>

                    <h4>PM:</h4>
                    <p>After work I head to class. I listen to one of my favorite weekly podcasts on the way to LC101 and get ready to put some work in! 
                        After class, I like to treat myself after a long week. I often have a "cheat meal" for dinner (Chick fil a is a favorite) and get home to catch the newest episode of <em>Rupaul's Drag Race</em>. 
                        I then get ready for bed and look forward to taking advantage of some free time. </p>

                    <p>Since I don't have to work, I typically sleep a little bit later and wake up around 7:30 am or 8 am. I then wake up and seize the day! I get through my morning routine and head out for be as productive as possible. 
                        I may head to doctor's appointments I've made or to the grocery store to get everything I need for the coming week before the stores get busy. 
                        I then will take care of any activities that I know will be crowded during the weekend (car wash, eye brow threading, Target runs, etc).</p>

                    <h4>PM:</h4>
                    <p>In the afternoon, I typically set up shop somewhere to work on the prep work for class the coming week and do any assignments I need to complete. 
                        My favorite spots include Bread Co (You Pick 2 is a problem), Starbucks, and my kitchen table. 
                        After a few hours of working, I will try to do something with friends whether it's Skyping with my friend group from college (we are all over the country), going to dinner, or heading out for the night (Start Bar is one of my favorites!). 
                        I then do my nighly routine and try to get to sleep at a decent time (midnight at the latest!).</p>

                    <p>This is my day to genuinely have time for me. I actually sleep late on Saturdays (10am) before doing my morning routine. 
                        I typically will work on class work or coding tutorials for 2-3 hours, but the rest of the day is for fun.

                    <p>I usually will start catching up on my TV shows on Saturday and I'll spend time with my family. 
                        I catch up on my social media feeds or I might go to random events around the city (<a href="https://rftmacncheese.com/" target="_blank">The RFT Mac and Cheese Throwdown</a> is an annual favorite). 
                        Saturday is the day where morning runs into the afternoon and time flies by way too quickly before I have to do my nightly routine and head to bed to be ready for work on….

                        I then spend the night cuddling with Cashmere while wrapping up any shows I didn't get to watch on Saturday and planning out my plans for world domination (aka setting goals for the weeks to come).</p>
